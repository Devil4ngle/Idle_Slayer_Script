# How to make it run?

(Works only with the Steam Version on Windows)

You have two options:

1) **Run with _.exe files** (easy):

   - Go to [Github Releases](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/Idle_Slayer_Script/releases)
   - Download `Idle Runner_x64.exe` or `Idle Runner_x32.exe` depending on your [System](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d).
   - Run `Idle Runner_x64.exe` / `Idle Runner_x32.exe`

2) **Run with source code** (harder):

    If you do not trust the exe files or your antivirus won't let you run it then you can do the following:
   
    - Download the [Source Code](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/Idle_Slayer_Script/releases) and ***unzip*** it.
    
    - Download and install [AutoIt Full Installation AND AutoIt Script Editor](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). ( You need to install both )

    - Right-click the file `Idle Runner.au3` and click `Compile with Options`

    - In the menu click `Compile Script`.
      
   It will generate exe files which should run without issue.
